Task 2
main()Setup:
 Initializes the MPI environment (sets up the communication lines) and retrieves the "ID card" (rank) for the current process and the total count of processes (universe size)
.Validation: Calls check_args immediately to ensure the user provided the necessary input number. It also calls check_uni_size to ensure the MPI universe is large enough to run.
Execution: Calls check_task, which acts as a traffic director, sending the process to do either "root work" or "client work" depending on its rank
.Cleanup: Shuts down the MPI environment safely before the program exits.check_args(argc, argv)Input Check: Looks at the command line inputs. It requires exactly 2 items: the program name and one number
.Conversion: If the input is valid, it converts the text string (e.g., "10") into an actual integer number.Error Handling: If the argument is missing, it prints a helpful error message explaining how to use the program and then forces the program to quit immediately.check_uni_size(uni_size)Safety Check: Verifies that the "universe" (number of processes) is at least 1.
Error Handling: If for some reason the universe is too small (less than 1), it prints an error and quits. Note: In this specific code, since min_uni_size is set to 1, this acts as a basic sanity check.check_task(uni_size, my_rank, num_arg
)The Decision Maker: This function splits the universe into two groups:Rank 0: is assigned the root_task.Everyone else (Rank > 0): is assigned the client_task.client_task(my_rank, num_arg)Calculation: Multiplies its own rank ID by the user-provided number (num_arg).Example: If Rank is 3 and input is 10, it calculates 30.
Transmission: Sends this single calculated value specifically to Rank 0.root_task(uni_size)Preparation: Sets up a running total variable (output_sum) starting at 0
Collection Loop: Loops through every other rank in the universe (from 1 up to uni_size - 1).Wait & Receive: Stops and waits for a message from the specific rank it is currently looping on.Accumulate: Takes the value received and adds it to the output_sum.Result: Prints the final total to the screen.2.
 The Mathematical FormulaYou asked for a one-operation mathematical formula that achieves the same result.Let's look at what the code effectively does:Input:
 Let $A$ be the argument provided by the user.Process: Every process $i$ (where $i > 0$) calculates $i \times A$.Summation:
 The root sums these up from rank $1$ to rank $N-1$ (where $N$ is the universe size).Mathematically,
 this is the sum:$$\text{Total} = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (i \times A)$$We can factor out $A$:$$\text{Total} = A \times \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i$$The sum of integers from $1$ to $k$ is a known arithmetic series formula: $\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.In our case,
 $k = N-1$. Substituting this in:$$\text{Total} = A \times \frac{(N-1) \times ((N-1)+1)}{2}$$Simplifying gives us the final formula:$$\text{Total} = A \times \frac{N(N-1)}{2}$$Verification:Using your example of 4 processors ($N=4$) and input 10 ($A=10$)
:Code: $10 + 20 + 30 = 60$Formula: $10 \times \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 10 \times \frac{12}{2} = 10 \times 6 = 60$
